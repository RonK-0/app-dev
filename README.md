### Author: Koi

`One day, Cocoa arrived in a town for a work-stay program as organized by her school. There, she excitingly entered the café "Rabbit House," expecting to be able to cuddle rabbits, but instead she found the Kafuu residence, her new home where she will be staying. In this town she will meet her precious and important friends, a responsible, calm but cute girl named Chino, a tough and soldier-esque girl named Rize, a spacey and quintessentially Japanese girl named Chiya, and the ordinary but dignified Syaro.`

2. Kage no Jitsuryokusha ni Naritakute *(The Eminence in Shadow)*

`Just like how everyone adored heroes in their childhood, a certain young man adored those powers hidden in shadows. Ninjas, rogues, shadowy mentor types, that sort of deal.
After hiding his strength and living the mediocre life of a NPC by day while undergoing frenzied training by night, he finally reincarnates into a different world and gains ultimate power.
The young man who is only pretending to be a power in the shadows… his subordinates who took him more seriously than he expected… and a giant organization in the shadows that gets accidentally trampled…
This is the story of a young boy who had adored powers in shadows possibly eventually reigning over the world of shadows in another world.`
